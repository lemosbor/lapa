## Features
1. The wrist-rest is part of the keyboard and is located above the main row keys.
2. The built-in mouse sensor allows you not to transfer your hand from the keyboard to the mouse.
3. The thumb keys are located on a separate part of the case, much higher than other keys.
4. All key surfaces are on different planes determined by the most effective pressing vector.
5. Minimum height. The surface of the lowest key is at a distance of 2 cm from the table.
6. The keycaps are flush with the body.
7. Replaceable oak pad for resting the wrist.

## Layout

Especially for the keyboard, I developed russian layout that provides the maximum frequency of trigrams with rolls and the minimum frequency same finger.
English alphabet is mapped with the Russian alphabet by phonetic: а - a, с - s, ш - sh, etc.
The A/P-key is used to switch the alphabet.

## Differences from the [2023 version](v23.md)
1. The weight has been reduced as much as possible (from 335 to 200 g for each half) for better handling.
2. The position of the fingers (keys) is lowered as much as possible to reduce the load on the elbows.
3. The shape and tilt of the body have been changed for a more comfortable hand position.
